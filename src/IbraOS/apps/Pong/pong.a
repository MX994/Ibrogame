@ General game structure:
@ game state consists of four sets of locals:
@ (r0, r1) = (paddle x, paddle y)
@       r2 = paddle velocity
@ (r3, r4) = (ball x, ball y)
@ (r5, r6) = (ball x vel, ball y vel)

@ initialize game state
_init:
moveri 0, 120
moveri 1, 240

moveri 2, 10

moveri r3, 120
moveri r4, 170

moveri r5, 20
moveri r6, -20

@ play the game
_gameloop: 
    while(ball is in bounds) {
        check if ball is out of bounds
        see what directions the joystick was pressed in
        move ball based on directions

        check if ball is out of bounds
        check if ball collides with paddle 
    }
